# Prolog and Logic for Computer Scientists
Repository of lab exercises and exams from "Logic for CS" subject (1st semester 2023)

S1 to S6 directories contain different exercises of each lab session:

- **S1** where there is a SAT solver implemented in C++
- **S2** with beginner exercises to logic programming with Prolog
- **S3** where we solve hard problems reducing them to SAT clauses with Prolog
- **S4** same as **S3** but optimizing a certain metric
- **S5** with more advanced problems in Prolog
- **S6** where we solve hard problems with CLPFD (constraint logic programming over finite domains) in Prolog

Furthermore there are two theory exams (Zeroeth
