# Prolog and Logic for Computer Scientists
Repository of lab exercises and exams from "Logic for CS" subject (1st semester 2023)

S1 to S6 directories contain different exercises of each lab session:

- **S1** where there is a SAT solver implemented in C++
- **S2** with beginner exercises to logic programming with Prolog
- **S3** where we solve hard problems reducing them to SAT clauses with Prolog
- **S4** same as **S3** but optimizing a certain metric
- **S5** with more advanced problems in Prolog
- **S6** where we solve hard problems with CLPFD (constraint logic programming over finite domains) in Prolog

Furthermore there are two theory exams (Zeroth-order Logic and First Order Logic resp.) and their solutions (suffixed with "-sol").
There are also two lab examsn (Labs S1-S3 being the midterm and S4-S6 final). Solutions are also attached.
